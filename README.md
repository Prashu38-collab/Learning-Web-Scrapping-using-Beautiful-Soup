Web Scraper Project

This project scrapes product data such as name, price, reviews,descriptions from a test e-commerce site for learning purposes.
Through this project I learned the difference of using find and find all, importance of class and how to convert the 
list obtained from find all to create meaningful data and change to csv using pandas.
